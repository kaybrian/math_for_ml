## Project Description and Questions

### 1. Write a Dynamic Function for Derivative Calculation:
- Create a Python function that calculates the derivative of any given function with respect to a variable x
- The function should take an input function f(x) as a string and return its derivative.
- Use SymPy or other suitable libraries for symbolic differentiation.


### 2. Test the Derivative Function with a Quadratic Equation:

- Define a quadratic equation of your choice that has at least two minima and two maxima.
- Test the derivative function created in Task 1 with this quadratic equation to verify its correctness.

### 3. Plot the Graph of the Quadratic Equation:

- Implement code to visualize the quadratic equation defined in Task 2.
- Use Matplotlib or other plotting libraries to create a graph of the quadratic function.

### 4. Identify Minima and Maxima:

- Create separate arrays to store the x-values of minima and maxima of the quadratic function.
- Print these arrays to display the critical points of the function.

### 5. Compute Global Minima and Maxima:

- Determine the global minima and maxima of the quadratic function.
- Print the coordinates of these points to identify the overall minimum and maximum values of the function.


### 6. Visualize the Global Minima and Maxima:

- Plot the graph of the quadratic function along with markers indicating the global minima and maxima.
- Ensure that the markers are visually distinguishable on the graph.
